## Description

Targeting Gen Z women, our service helps you find hidden hotspots that are perfect for sharing. We will recommend beautiful and unique spaces, such as cocktail bars with no doors and Amorepacific design, where users can gain new experiences. We will also recommend hotspots that match their personality, so they can discover their own tastes and make new friends. In this way, our service will introduce users to a variety of attractive spaces, adding pleasure and satisfaction to their lives.
